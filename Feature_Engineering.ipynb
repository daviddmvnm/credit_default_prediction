    "## Objectives of this Notebook\n",
    "In this notebook, I will download reduced DataFrames that consist of the columns deemed most important by a simple decision tree model, along with aggregated features of the columns considered least informative by the model. The goals of this feature engineering process are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Engineering**: I will perform further feature engineering to model various factors that, based on domain knowledge and insights from the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), are key predictors of default risk, I will then use RFE o slect an optimal feature set\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pipeline Creation**: A pipeline will be created to generate these features from a reduced dataset with matching columns. This pipeline will be utilized on the `application_test_reduced` dataset and can be hypothetically applied to new incoming data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Engineering Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Iniital Hypotheses**: I will formulate hypotheses based on insights from EDA as to what features could improve predictive power\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Automate transformations**: I will utilise tools like sklearn pipelines to handle transformations sequentially, with modular steps for scaling and feature creation. This is vital for point 3...\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Batch test created features**: I will be creating and evaluating features in batches to manage complexity and track any impact of created features and transformations, these features will be grouped by hypothesis, these features will be evaluated against simple baseline models.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Assessing Robustness**: The robustness of selected features will be tested across a variety of different models and data splits and feature sets, cross validation wll used to assess the models ability to generalise.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Selection**: Confirm a final high-quality feature set. Finalise the selection with techniques like RFE and SHAP\n",

    "## Model Training and Evaluation Strategy\n",
    "When comparing model performance, I will follow this strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Training and Testing**: Initially, I will train and test models using the `application_train` dataset for convenience. This approach will allow for iterative refinement, hyperparameter tuning, and analysis of feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Final Model Training**: Once satisfactory performance is achieved on the training set, I will retrain the model using the entire `application_train` dataset to leverage all available data for enhanced performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Preprocessing and Feature Engineering on Application Test**: I will apply the same preprocessing and feature engineering pipelines to the `application_test` dataset to ensure consistency in feature representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scoring Metrics**: After applying the trained model to the `application_test` set, I will calculate scoring metrics (such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, etc.) to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured approach will help ensure a thorough and systematic feature engineering process, leading to robust model performance."

    "# Hypotheses from EDA\n",
    "### 1. Hypothesis on Skewness and Feature Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: *Right-skewed financial features may reduce model stability and predictive accuracy. Applying log transformations to these skewed variables will improve distribution normality, enabling models to better capture relationships.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale**:\n",
    "- Financial metrics like income, credit balance, and receivables show heavy right-skew due to high-value outliers.\n",
    "- Skewness can reduce performance in models that assume or benefit from Gaussian-like distributions (e.g., linear models, some tree-based algorithms), potentially introducing bias and reducing interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**:\n",
    "- Apply log transformations to skewed financial features and analyze the resulting distributions.\n",
    "- Assess model performance on both transformed and untransformed data, measuring predictive accuracy and stability across validation sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Hypothesis on Non-linear Relationship between Income and Default Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: *Income does not have a linear relationship with default probability; rather, higher incomes only start correlating with reduced default rates beyond the 75th percentile. Using polynomial features will help capture this non-linear relationship.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale**:\n",
    "- EDA revealed that income levels up to the 75th percentile show a relatively uniform default rate, suggesting that default likelihood remains high for lower income levels.\n",
    "- Income only begins to meaningfully predict reduced default rates for values above this threshold, indicating a non-linear relationship.\n",
    "- Introducing polynomial terms for income could allow the model to account for this non-linear effect, making it sensitive to higher incomes while maintaining accuracy for lower ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**:\n",
    "- Generate polynomial features for income and evaluate their predictive power against baseline models with linear income terms.\n",
    "- Analyze the impact of the polynomial features on model performance, specifically regarding predictive accuracy for higher-income applicants.\n",
    "- In addition to this there may be predicitve power in binning applicants based on income, this binned feature could then be interacted with other features to capture more granularity in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "### 3. Hypothesis on Financial Stability and Wealth (particularly for Lower Credit applications)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: *Individuals purchasing lower-value properties, possibly attempting to stay within perceived financial limits, are likely of lower income and may face a higher risk of default due to lower wealth accumulation and financial stability.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale**:\n",
    "- EDA indicates a spike in default rates for individuals purchasing properties within the 25-50% price range and in the 25-50% credit range as these two are intrinsically tied together, suggesting these individuals may lack the financial flexibility to absorb unexpected expenses.\n",
    "- Lower-value properties are typically associated with buyers from lower-income brackets, who may experience financial constraints that increase vulnerability to financial shocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Selected Features for Financial Vulnerability and Stability:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Income / Annuity**  \n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Assesses the income proportion committed to annuity payments.  \n",
    "   - **Hypothesis**: A lower ratio suggests a higher financial burden, indicating less flexibility to absorb unexpected expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Income / Days Birth**  \n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Proxies for lifetime earning potential relative to age.  \n",
    "   - **Hypothesis**: Lower values imply under-earning for one’s age, indicating limited wealth accumulation and resilience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Days Employed / Days Birth**  \n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Measures employment stability relative to age.  \n",
    "   - **Hypothesis**: A lower ratio indicates shorter employment durations, signaling possible job instability and financial vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Current Payments Mean / Income**  \n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Reflects the debt load in relation to income.  \n",
    "   - **Hypothesis**: Higher values suggest limited disposable income, making individuals more susceptible to financial shocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Days Employed * Income**  \n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Captures steady income over an extended employment history.  \n",
    "   - **Hypothesis**: Higher values indicate stability and wealth accumulation potential, highlighting individuals with greater resilience even in lower income brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features aim to identify financially vulnerable individuals by modeling the interactions between income, employment stability, and financial commitments, providing insight into their resilience against financial shocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Hypothesis on \"Overextension\" as a key determinant of default risk across all incomes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: *Overextension financially, loans large relative to income and existing financial strain are key predictors of default*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale**:\n",
    " In the loan application data, defaulters often show loan annuities that are less proportional to their income, suggesting overextension. Financially overextended applicants may be at a higher risk of default, particularly if they lack income flexibility for unexpected expenses. To try and model this I will be looking at credit utilisation in addition to how factors like annuity and requested credit relate to an applicants income.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Selected Features to Model Overextension (Loan Application Only):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Annuity-to-Income Ratio**  \n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Represents the percentage of income dedicated to loan repayments.  \n",
    "   - **Hypothesis**: Higher ratios indicate overextension, as a greater portion of income is allocated to debt servicing, reducing flexibility for other financial needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Credit-to-Income Ratio**  \n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Measures the requested loan amount relative to income.  \n",
    "   - **Hypothesis**: Higher values suggest a heavier loan burden, indicating that applicants may be overextending themselves relative to their earning capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Annuity-to-Credit Ratio**  \n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Reflects the loan terms in relation to the loan size.  \n",
    "   - **Hypothesis**: Lower ratios might indicate longer loan terms with smaller payments, potentially chosen to accommodate affordability, signaling overextension if the applicant struggles with larger debts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Current Payments Mean / Income**  \n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Assesses how much income is allocated toward servicing debt (from payments mean).  \n",
    "   - **Hypothesis**: Higher values indicate limited financial flexibility, as more of the applicant’s income is used to service debt, elevating default risk if other expenses arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features aim to capture overextension solely based on loan size, repayment structure, and income. An applicant exhibiting high values across these metrics is likely at increased risk for default due to overextension within the loan application context, without needing credit card limit data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Hypothesis on Deviation from Group Norms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: *Individuals whose financial behaviors significantly deviate from the mean within their categorical groups (e.g., education level, gender, marital status) may exhibit distinct default risk profiles. Calculating deviations from group means for financial metrics will capture these atypical behaviors, enhancing the model’s ability to detect high-risk applicants.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale**:\n",
    "- In our EDA few categorical features were informative alone, just knowing marital status doesn't tell you much, however is this due to a lack of granularity in the original features?\n",
    "- Group means for financial metrics within each category (e.g., average income within each education level) can serve as a \"norm\" or baseline.\n",
    "- Individuals who significantly diverge from these norms (e.g., low income within a high-education group) may exhibit different levels of financial stability or risk tolerance than others in their group.\n",
    "- Deviations from these group means can reveal patterns that aren’t captured by categories alone, allowing for a more granular assessment of financial behavior and risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**:\n",
    "- Create mean difference features for groups\n",
    "- Additioanlly interaction features will be created, interacting features like education level, gender, marital status on key numerical features like income, credit limits and so on.\n",

    "\n",

    "- I will include a range of metrics to evaluate created features on, however the most important features I will be tryng to improve upon here are Recall and AUC score, low precision isn't a massive concern at this stage as ideally through labelling and the meta model, these scores can be improved dramatically.\n"

    "   - **Scaling Only** and **Log-Scaled Transformation** both produced significant AUC gains over the untransformed dataset, with **log transformation** providing an additional 0.15% gain.\n",
    "   - A notable 12.38% AUC improvement occurred from applying scaling to the untransformed data, underscoring scaling's importance for model convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Precision**:\n",
    "   - **Precision** experienced minimal gains from log transformation, showing a slight 0.14% increase.\n",
    "   - Compared to the untransformed dataset, scaling alone improved precision by 16.83%.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recall**:\n",
    "   - Interestingly, recall decreased by 0.95% with the addition of log transformation, but scaling alone provided a substantial recall gain of 20.91% over the untransformed baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **F1 Score**:\n",
    "   - The F1 score was largely consistent across configurations, with a marginal 0.11% decrease with log transformation.\n",
    "   - From the untransformed dataset, scaling improved F1 score by 17.64%, showing the balance achieved with scaling alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**:  \n",
    "The results indicate that **scaling without log transformation** provides the most balanced performance gains across recall and F1 score, while **log transformation offers a modest boost in AUC**. These findings suggest that, for this model, scaling alone is sufficient to achieve optimal performance gains without compromising recall or F1 balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis 1: \"Correcting for Right Skew will improve model performance\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this analysis, **Hypothesis 1 is only partially supported**. Correcting for right skew with log transformations slightly improves AUC but does not yield substantial gains in precision, recall, or F1 score beyond what scaling alone achieves. This suggests that, while addressing skewness may help in certain metrics, it does not significantly impact overall performance in this context.\n"

    "## Feature Selection Choice: 40 Features\n",
    "\n",
    "After analyzing the Precision, Recall, and F1 Score trends across different numbers of selected features, I chose to use **40 features** for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Maximizing Recall and F1 Score**:\n",
    "   - The plot of Precision, Recall, and F1 Score against the number of features shows a slight uptick in Recall and F1 Score around the 40-feature mark. Although Recall and F1 initially plateau around 10-15 features, this secondary increase at 40 features suggests that additional predictive information is being captured, particularly for identifying positive cases.\n",
    "   - Since my primary objective is to maximize the model’s ability to identify positives (high Recall) while maintaining a balanced performance (high F1 Score), selecting 40 features allows me to capture these small but meaningful improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Balancing Complexity and Performance Gains**:\n",
    "   - While using fewer features (10-15) could simplify the model, the minor performance gain at 40 features is valuable in this context, as it could enhance the model's robustness without a substantial increase in complexity.\n",
    "   - By selecting 40 features, I aim to achieve an optimized balance between model complexity and predictive power, capturing nuanced patterns that may not be as evident with fewer features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Focus on Small Gains**:\n",
    "   - Although the improvements are incremental, the secondary spike in Recall and F1 at 40 features justifies the decision to prioritize every possible gain. This choice reflects an optimization approach that values incremental improvements in predictive performance, even if they come at the cost of slightly increased model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, selecting **40 features** provides an optimal configuration that balances precision and recall while capturing minor but valuable performance gains. This choice is particularly beneficial for applications where maximizing positive case identification (Recall) and maintaining a balanced performance (F1 Score) are critical to model success.\n"

    "### Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AUC Score**:\n",
    "   - The AUC with RFE-selected features saw a slight decrease of -0.13% compared to using all features, indicating a minimal reduction in the model's discrimination ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Precision**:\n",
    "   - Precision improved by +0.65% with RFE-selected features, suggesting that the model with selected features provides a marginally better rate of true positives among predicted positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recall**:\n",
    "   - Recall increased by +0.74% with RFE-selected features, indicating a slightly higher proportion of actual positives captured when using the RFE-selected subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **F1 Score**:\n",
    "   - The F1 score gained +0.67% with RFE-selected features, reflecting a modest improvement in balancing precision and recall compared to using all features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The model with RFE-selected features demonstrated small but meaningful gains in Precision, Recall, and F1 Score over the model using all features, while incurring only a minor reduction in AUC. These results suggest that the RFE-selected feature subset achieves comparable (or slightly improved) performance with reduced complexity. By focusing on a smaller, more relevant feature set, the model may benefit from improved interpretability and reduced risk of overfitting, with minimal trade-offs in performance.\n",
